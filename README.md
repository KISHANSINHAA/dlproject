# Face Mask Detection – CNN-Based End-to-End Pipeline

This project implements a CNN-based face mask detection system for smart surveillance
applications such as airports, malls, and public places.

The model detects:
- with_mask
- without_mask
- mask_weared_incorrect

The system supports training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment
using TensorFlow, OpenCV, Streamlit, and TFLite.
